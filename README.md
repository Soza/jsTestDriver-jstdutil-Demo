This project is a simple setup of js-test-driver to test JS features. Associated configurations and the sample files are included for quick reference. 

This project also uses Jstdutil - a ruby wrapper over jsTestDriver to automate the test execution. The utility waits for local files changes along with intelligent guesses on which test cases were affected, which gets executed automatically. To learn more about the the ruby wrapper, please visit -> http://cjohansen.no/en/javascript/jstdutil_a_ruby_wrapper_over_jstestdriver

Requirements:
